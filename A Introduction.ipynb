    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "Data science studies how to use data to solve problems and answer research questions. It constitutes all parts of a data-intensive workflow, from the beginning (e.g., data collection, data preparation), through the middle (e.g., data mining, supervised/unsupervised machine learning) to the end (e.g., presenting insights and/or deploying a software system). It helps to think about data science as science, meaning it uses the scientific method we are all familiar with (1. observe/question, 2. research, 3. form a hypothesis, 4. test with experiment, 5. analyze data, 6. report conclusions), but with a focus on data:\n",
    "1. Identify: pick something you are curious about and collect data about it\n",
    "1. Understand: get familiar with your data and its \"bigger picture\"\n",
    "1. Process: prepare your data for analyses \n",
    "1. Analyze: look closely at the data to discover previously unknown patterns, trends, associations, groups, etc\n",
    "1. Conclude: draw valid conclusions and discuss potential action items\n",
    "1. Communicate: share your knowledge with your targeted audience\n",
    "\n",
    "What are examples of data in the real-world and how is that data being analyzed?\n",
    "* Medical data collected from electronic health records, physician/nurse notes, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to determine health risk factors, onset of early disease, insurance billing, etc.\n",
    "* Time series data collected from sensors installed in the environment or worn on the body (wearables)\n",
    "    * Analyzed to detect physical activity, daily behavior, changes in behavior over time, etc.\n",
    "* Social media data collected from social networks, posting, news feeds, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to suggest friends, deliver user-specific content, recommend products, target advertising, etc.\n",
    "* Financial data collected from banking transactions, trading, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to project stock market trends, recommend certain investments, determine credit scores, etc.\n",

    "* [Data collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection): Designing data collection protocols and executing the protocols to collect data to be used for analysis.\n",
    "* [Data representation/cleaning/munging/wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling): Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured and clean form.\n",
    "* [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining): The computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.\n",
    "* [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning): Provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data."

    "## Python\n",
    "In this class, we are going to learn and use the Python programming language for all of our coding assignments. According to [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022), Python is the top programming language and according to [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/python-preferred-languages-data-science.html), Python is the most popular programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (followed by R). \n",

    "### Why Use Programming for Data Science?\n",
    "* Faster than analyzing by hand (especially for large data)!\n",
    "* Reuse other data, same data different params/settings\n",
    "* Enables a form of ‚Äúrepeatability‚Äù (and ideally, transparency)\n",
    "    * can repeat ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù and get the same result\n",
    "    * no ‚Äúmagic‚Äù steps\n",
    "* Still important, however, to write down steps (log)\n",
    "    * ideally, someone should be able to take your data, program, and description of steps, rerun everything, and get the same results!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Python for Data Science?\n",
    "Advantages of learning Python include:\n",
    "1. Easy to learn\n",
    "1. Free, open source\n",
    "1. Support for the life cycle of software (prototyping, development, testing, release, maintenance)\n",
    "1. Many available libraries, especially for data analytics:\n",
    "    1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [sci-kits](https://scikits.appspot.com/) (especially [sci-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning)\n",
    "    1. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "    1. [Plotting libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting), such as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)\n",
    "1. Many supported GUI backends\n",
    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",
    "    * Python is an interpreted language, which means it can run on any system with the Python interpreter installed; however, this is also a disadvantage in some ways, meaning Python code can be slow to run, compared with compiled languages like C\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Python Distribution and IDE\n",
    "We will use the [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python 3 distribution. This is a free distribution of Python version 3 available for Windows, OS X, and Linux. You can download Anaconda3 [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and view the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).\n",

I encourage you to use Spyder or Visual Studio Code (or one of the following [Anaconda-supported IDEs](https://support.anaconda.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2880333-using-an-ide-with-anaconda) to develop your Python code)."
